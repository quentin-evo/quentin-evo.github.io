The theory of divergence by trophic polymorphism provides powerful explanations for the diversification of vertebrates. This theory has recently been extended to capture the interactions of developmental, ecological and evolutionary processes. However, this extended framework doesn't thoroughly account for the evolution of reproductive isolation.

My recent PhD project revolved around the Arctic charr morphs of Thingvallavatn as an ideal system to integrate reproductive isolation to the theory of divergence by resource polymorphism.

Using common-garden experiments, I studied how hybridization affects the structure of trait covariance in diverging sympatric morphs. This involved comprehensive studies on morphology, developmental timing and feeding behaviour. I also investigated how personality traits evolve during adaptive divergence and may be broken down by hybridization.

I am also much interested in the molecular processes underlying the evolution of canalization and the potential impacts on population divergence. I dedicated a big part of my research in understanding how gene expression variability shifts as populations evolve toward distinct fitness optima and how this could be could be affected by gene flow.

My projects also involved field studies and mating experiments aimed at understading the barriers to gene flow among Arctic charr morphs.

Most of this work was conducted as part of the [Arctic charr research group of the University of Iceland](https://bleikja.hi.is/).
