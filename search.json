    "text": "How adaptive changes occurring within populations (microevolution) generate diversity across the tree of life (macroevolution) is a classical yet unresolved issue in evolution. Insight on this question can be provided by development, which may act as a keystone conciliating the two pillars of micro- and macroevolution by facilitating or constraining evolutionary changes over long evolutionary time scales.\nI am exploring this topic by studying the skull of lacertid lizards. Specifically, I am conducting comparative studies using X-ray microtomography data to investigate how different embryonic germ layers may impose developmental biases in distinct regions of the skull, potentially resulting in conserved patterns of variation across the phylogeny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrasting skull shapes of in two lacertid lizards. Meroles sp. (left) and Nucras sp. (right).\n\n\n\nThis project is par of a wider a set of studies conducted by the Feiner-Uller research group."

    "text": "The theory of divergence by trophic polymorphism provides powerful explanations for the diversification of vertebrates. This theory has recently been extended to capture the interactions of developmental, ecological and evolutionary processes. However, this extended framework doesn’t thoroughly account for the evolution of reproductive isolation.\nMy recent PhD project revolved around the Arctic charr morphs of Thingvallavatn as an ideal system to integrate reproductive isolation to the theory of divergence by resource polymorphism.\n\n\n\nThe four morphs of Arctic charr in Thingvallavatn with their habitat and diet. Horta-Lacueva et al. (2021) Animal Behaviour.\n\n\nUsing common-garden experiments, I studied how hybridization affects the structure of trait covariance in diverging sympatric morphs. This involved comprehensive studies on morphology, developmental timing and feeding behaviour. I also investigated how personality traits evolve during adaptive divergence and may be broken down by hybridization.\nI am also much interested in the molecular processes underlying the evolution of canalization and the potential impacts on population divergence. A big part of my research aimed at understanding how gene expression variability shifts as populations evolve toward distinct fitness optima, and how this could be could be affected by gene flow.\n\n\n\nGene expression variability enables to infer how canalisation evolved in contrasting morphs and the developmental consequences in hybrids. More details in Horta-Lacueva et al. (2021) Communications Biology.\n\n\nMy projects also involved field studies and mating experiments aimed at understanding the barriers to gene flow among Arctic charr morphs.\nMost of this work was conducted as part of the Arctic charr research group of the University of Iceland.\n\nKey publications:\nHorta-lacueva Q.J.B., Jónsson, Z.O., Thorholludottir D.A.V., Hallgrímsson, B., Kapralova K.H.
