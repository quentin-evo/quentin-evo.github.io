Hello World
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>

<h1> Hello, I am Quentin HORTA-LACUEVA </h1>
#### I am currently working working as a postdoctoral researcher at Lund University, Sweden

I am interested in the developmental origins of morphological diversity. During my PhD, I studied how hybridization affects feeding morphology, developmental timing and animal personality in Arctic charr morphs. Now focusing on the evolution of the skull in lizards, I investigate how particular types of embryonic cells may influence diversification and convergence.

My main fields of research are: Ecology & Evolution / Developmental Biology / Genomics

My main research methods include: Genomics, Bioinformatics, Geometric morphometrics and to some extant Quantitative Genetics
