title: Skull evolvability
---

How adaptive changes occurring within populations (microevolution) generate diversity across the tree of life (macroevolution) is a classical yet unresolved issue in evolution. Insight on this question can be provided by development, which may act as a keystone conciliating the two pillars of micro- and macroevolution by facilitating or constraining evolutionary changes over long evolutionary time scales.

I am exploring this topic by studying the skull of lacertid lizards. Specifically, I am conducting comparative studies using X-ray microtomography data to investigate how different embryonic germ layers may impose developmental biases in distinct regions of the skull, potentially resulting in conserved patterns of variation across the phylogeny.

This project is par of a wider a set of studies conducted by the [Feiner-Uller research group](https://feiner-uller-group.se/).
